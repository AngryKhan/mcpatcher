<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>MCPatcher works by modifying Minecraft at the Java bytecode level.  Other
mod frameworks for Minecraft allow you to add whole new classes to the game,
but limit your ability to modify the behavior of existing classes to a few
pre-defined "hooks".  MCPatcher can potientially modify any part of the game as
long as you can write a regular expression for the code you are looking
for.  To put it another way, MCPatcher isn't particularly well-suited to load
Mod Loader <em>mods</em> into Minecraft, but it could potentially insert
the Mod Loader framework <em>itself</em> in a version-independent way.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>

<li>At least intermediate knowledge of Java or a sufficiently Java-like
language.  If this is your first programming experience, you're in for a world
of hurt.</li>

<li>Knowledge or willingness to learn some details about Java bytecode.  If
you've studied any flavor of assembly language, there are no big surprises
here.  Java bytecode is a stack-based assembly-like language where many of the
opcodes take 16-bit indexes into a shared "constant pool".  The constant pool
contains values for basic Java types (strings, floats, doubles, etc.) and
references to class, field, and method names used in the source code.</li>

<li>Any Java IDE.  I use 
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html">IntelliJ
IDEA Community Edition 10.5</a> for MCPatcher development, but Eclipse for
looking at the Minecraft source.</li>

<li>(Recommended) The latest
<a href="http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases">MCP</a> release and a
decompiled Minecraft tree.</li>

<li>(Recommended) An IDE plugin to view Java bytecode.  I recommend
<a href="http://andrei.gmxhome.de/bytecode/index.html">Bytecode Outline</a> for
Eclipse users.  Whatever you use, keep in mind that MCP's deobfuscated source
does not always compile back into the same bytecode that is in the original
minecraft.jar.  If there is any doubt, unpack an unmodified minecraft.jar and
use <code>javap -c -private &lt;classname&gt;</code> to disassemble it.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="building">Building</h3>

<p>The mcpatcher application jar doubles as a library.  Start a new Java
project and include the mcpatcher jar in your build path.  I suggest having
several modules in your project:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>mod</b> &mdash; Contains the Mod class itself.  Depends on: mcpatcher
jar, <b>shared</b>.</li>
<li><b>newcode</b> &mdash; Contains code that will be inserted into
minecraft.jar.  Depends on: <b>stubs</b>, <b>shared</b></li>
<li><b>stubs</b> &mdash; Dummy Minecraft classes required to build newcode.
Depends on: nothing</li>
<li><b>shared</b> &mdash; Contains code shared by both mod and newcode.
Depends on: nothing</li>
</ul>

<p>Only mod, newcode, and shared are included in the final jar file that you
will release for your mod.</p>

<p>After setting up the basic project structure, create a new source file, say
MyMod.java:</p>

<pre>
package com.example.me;

import com.pclewis.mcpatcher.*;
import static javassist.bytecode.Opcode.*;

public class MyMod extends Mod {
    public MyMod() {
        name = "My Awesome Mod";
        author = "Me";
        version = "1.0";
        description = "Now with 2.1% more awesome!";
    }
}
</pre>

<p>The Mod class must have a public no-argument constructor.</p>

<p>Once you've built a jar file, put it in <code>&lt;minecraft
dir&gt;/mcpatcher-mods/</code> and start MCPatcher to try it out.  You should
see your mod listed along with HD Textures, etc.</p>

<h3>Mod structure</h3>

<pre>

|-- name, author, etc.
|-- ClassMod

<p>The top-level class for a mod is called Mod.  MCPatcher automatically loads
all public classes that extend the Mod class.  The basic structure of a mod is
some general information and a set of ClassMods.  A ClassMod is a part of the
mod that applies to a single class and contains ClassSignatures and
ClassPatches.</p>

<p>ClassSignatures determine what target class the ClassMod should be applied
to.  The two main subclasses are BytecodeSignature and ConstSignature.
BytecodeSignatures match a particular bytecode sequence.  ConstSignatures match
a constant (string, float, etc.) in the class's constant poll.  To match a
class, <em>all</em> ClassSignatures in the ClassMod must match, so you can use
a mixture of these types.  Unless you specify otherwise, each ClassMod must
match exactly one class in the input minecraft.jar.  0 or 2+ will cause your
Mod to be greyed out in MCPatcher's UI.  Once MCPatcher has located the
ClassMod's target, it automatically sets up a mapping from your ClassMod's name
to the obfuscated class name in minecraft.jar.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The order that ClassSignatures are matched depends on
the order of the files in minecraft.jar.  It is not guaranteed to be the same
as the order they are listed in the mod.  Do not assume that one ClassSignature
will be resolved before another.</p>

<p>FieldMappers and MethodMappers are evaluated in a second pass once all of
the ClassSignatures have been successfully resolved.  This means they can refer
to unobfuscated class names as long as those classes have been mapped by
ClassSignatures.  FieldMappers and MemberMappers allow you to locate individual
members within a class and assign meaningful names to them to refer to later.
The default behavior is to map by type, but you can override this behavior to
match on other criteria.</p>

<p>ClassPatches do the actual work of making changes to the target class file.
There are subclasses to do the most common types changes.  BytecodePatch
matches a target bytecode sequence and replaces it.  MakeMemberPublicPatch and
AddMethodPatch do what they say on the tin.  If none of these meet your needs,
extend ClassMod yourself or use the prePatch and postPatch hooks to do other
processing.</p>

<p>A ClassMap contains the mapping from meaningful names like
RenderEngine.registerTextureFX to obfuscated names like hf.a.  Each mod has its
own ClassMap, which avoids naming conflicts with other mods.  You probably
won't need to add anything to the ClassMap directly, but you will need to be
aware of its existence.</p>

<p>The JavaRef subclasses (FieldRef, MethodRef, InterfaceMethodRef, and
ClassRef) are used whenever you want to refer to a particular class or class
member by name.</p>

<p>BinaryRegex provides methods for creating match expressions for
BytecodeSignatures and BytecodePatches.  To refer to classes, methods, or
fields, use the reference() method with one of the JavaRef subclasses.  To
refer to string, floating point, or integer constants, use the push()
method.</p>

<h3>Cross-references</h3>

<p>Sometimes the defining feature of a class or class member is how it is used
by another class.  This is particularly true of interfaces, which have no code
of their own to match against.  The BytecodeSignature.addXref method allows you
to define cross-references from a known class to one you are trying to
identify.  In the match expression, capture the GETFIELD/INVOKEVIRTUAL/etc.
opcode.  Then call addXref and provide a corresponding JavaRef with the desired
deobfuscated names.</p>

<h3>Adding or replacing Minecraft classes</h3>

<p>You may want to add a new class or replace an existing class.  To do this,
add the filename to the filesToAdd list in your Mod's constructor.  Pass the
full path within your jar minus the leading slash.  MCPatcher will get the
file's InputStream at the appropriate time during patching.</p>

<p>In the source for your new class file, you can use the descriptive names for
any Minecraft classes you refer to.  MCPatcher automatically maps any classes,
fields, and methods in the ClassMap to their obfuscated names when it injects
your new class into the output jar.  But first you will need to create stubs
for the Minecraft classes you refer to in order to build the new class file
itself.  This is only to satisfy the compiler however; the stubs do not need to
be included in your jar file.</p>

<h3 id="tips">Tips for writing mods</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Make your patches general</b> &mdash; Don't assume that GETFIELD 0x13
will always give you the RenderEngine object.  The next version of Minecraft
may introduce a new field and renumber everything.  Use a ClassSignature to map
the RenderEngine class, then use a FieldMapper to locate the class member of
that type.  Use capture groups to save bits of code between the stuff you care
about and echo them unmodified back in the output.</li>

<li><b>...but not too general</b> &mdash; <code>BIPUSH 16 IF_ICMPLT</code> by
itself is not a good way to uniquely identify a class.  It could match almost
anywhere.  The best matches are unique numerical constants or strings.  Next
best is a series of arithmetic operations that is integral to what the class
does.  A class doesn't match unless <em>all</em> of its ClassSignatures match,
so a set of several non-specific signatures can be more effective than a single
super-specific one.</li>

<li><b>Turn up the logging</b> &mdash; Start MCPatcher from the command line
with the <code>-loglevel 5</code> option to see a side-by-side view of the
bytecode before and after each replacement.  Add
<code>-ignorebuiltinmods</code> to hide the built-in font and texture
mods.</li>

<li><b>Don't write complex replacement bytecode</b> &mdash; Don't write 100
lines of new bytecode only to get a StackUnderflowError because you left off
an ALOAD_0 somewhere.  If you need to do anything complex, gather up any
private members you need (or make them public) and pass them off to a static
method you write in Java source to do the hard stuff.</li>

<li><b>Look at the built-in mods</b> &mdash; HDFont.java is fairly simple.  It
modifies a single class and makes fairly straightforward bytecode changes that
are independent of each other.  HDTexture.java is a beast, but it has
examples of nearly all of MCPatcher's capabilities.  BetterGrass.java is in
between these two extremes.</li>
