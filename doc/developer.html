<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>MCPatcher works by modifying Minecraft at the Java bytecode level.  Other
mod frameworks for Minecraft allow you to add whole new classes to the game,
but limit your ability to modify the behavior of existing classes to a few
pre-defined "hooks".  MCPatcher can potientially modify any part of the game as
long as you can write a regular expression for the code you are looking
for.  To put it another way, MCPatcher isn't particularly well-suited to load
Mod Loader <em>mods</em> into Minecraft, but it could potentially insert
the Mod Loader framework <em>itself</em> in a version-independent way.</p>

<p>To build mods for MCPatcher, in addition to knowing the Java language, you
will need to learn about Java bytecode and the structure of .class files.  None
of it is terribly hard.  I knew almost nothing about this stuff when I started
contributing to MCPatcher.  Java bytecode is a stack-based assembly-like
language where many of the opcodes take 16-bit indexes into a shared "constant
pool".  The constant pool contains values for basic Java types (strings,
floats, doubles, etc.) and references to class, field, and method names used
in the source code.</p>

<h3 id="building">Building</h3>

<p>I used <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html">IntelliJ
IDEA Community Edition 10</a> for development, but any Java development
environment should work.  I'd also recommend getting the latest
<a href="http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/index.php/MCP_Releases">MCP</a> and having a
decompiled Minecraft tree handy.  Also helpful is an IDE plugin that lets you
view Java bytecode.  Keep in mind that MCP's deobfuscated source does not
always compile back into the same bytecode that is in the original
minecraft.jar.  If there is any doubt, unpack an unmodified minecraft.jar and
use <code>javap -c &lt;classname&gt;</code> to disassemble it.</p>

<p>Once you have everything set up, make sure mcpatcher.jar is in your build
path and write some code starting with

<pre>
import com.pclewis.mcpatcher.*;
import static javassist.bytecode.Opcode.*;

public class MyMod extends Mod {
}
</pre>

<p>When you've build a jar file, put it in <code>&lt;minecraft
dir&gt;/mcpatcher-mods/</code> and start MCPatcher to try it out.</p>

stuck.</p>

<p>The top-level class for a mod is called Mod.  MCPatcher automatically loads
all public classes that extend the Mod class.  The basic structure of a mod is
some general information and a set of ClassMods.  A ClassMod is a part of the
mod that applies to a single class and contains ClassSignatures and
ClassPatches.</p>

<p>ClassSignatures determine what target class the ClassMod should be applied
to.  Unless you specify otherwise, each ClassMod must match exactly one class
in the input minecraft.jar.  0 or 2+ means your Mod will be greyed out in
MCPatcher's UI.  Once MCPatcher has located the ClassMod's target, it
automatically sets up a mapping from your ClassMod's name to the obfuscated
class name in minecraft.jar.</p>

<p>FieldMappers and MethodMappers are evaluated in a second pass once all of
the classes have been successfully mapped.  These allow you to locate
individual members within a class and assign meaningful names to them to refer
to later.  The default behavior is to map by type, but you can override this
behavior to match on other criteria.</p>

<p>ClassPatches do the actual work of making changes to the target class
file.  Subclasses do various things. BytecodePatch must implement methods to
return a match expression and generate replacement bytecode.
MakeMemberPublicPatch and AddMethodPatch do what they say on the tin.  If none
of these meet your needs, ClassMod offers prePatch and postPatch hooks to do
other processing.</p>

<p>ClassMap contains the mapping from meaningful names like
RenderEngine.registerTextureFX to obfuscated names like hf.a.  You probably
don't need to add anything to it directly, but you will need to be aware of its
existence.</p>

<p>BinaryRegex provides methods for creating match expressions for
BytecodeSignatures and BytecodePatches.  To refer to classes, methods, or
fields, use the reference() method with one of the JavaRef subclasses.  To
refer to string, floating point, or integer constants, use the push()
method.</p>

<h3>Adding or replacing Minecraft classes</h3>

<p>You may want to add a new class or replace an existing class.  To do this,
add the filename to the filesToAdd or filesToReplace list in your Mod's
constructor.  Place these files in a folder called newcode on the root of your
mod's jar file.  MCPatcher will ask for the file's InputStream at the
appropriate time.</p>

<p>In the source for your new class file, you may use the descriptive names for
any Minecraft classes.  MCPatcher automatically maps any classes, fields, and
methods in the ClassMap to their obfuscated names when it injects your new
class into the output jar.</p>

<p>You will need to create stubs for the Minecraft classes you refer to in
order to build the new class file itself, but the stubs do not need to be
included in your jar file.</p>

<h3 id="tips">Tips for writing mods</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Make your patches general</b> &mdash; Don't assume that field 0x13
will always be the RenderEngine object.  The next version of Minecraft may
introduce a new field and renumber everything.  Use a ClassSignature to map the
RenderEngine class, then use a FieldMapper to locate the class member of that
type.  Use capture groups to save bits of code between the stuff you care about
and echo them unmodified back in the output.</li>

<li><b>...but not too general</b> &mdash; <code>BIPUSH 16 IF_ICMPLT</code> by
itself is not a good way to uniquely identify a class.  It could match almost
anywhere.  The best matches are unique numerical constants or strings.  Next
best is a series of arithmetic operations that is integral to what the class
does.  A class doesn't match unless <em>all</em> of its ClassSignatures match,
so a set of several non-specific signatures can be more effective than a single
super-specific one.</li>

<li><b>Turn up the logging</b> &mdash; Start MCPatcher from the command line
with the <code>-loglevel 5</code> option to see a side-by-side view of the
bytecode before and after each replacement.  Add
<code>-ignorebuiltinmods</code> to hide the built-in font and texture
mods.</li>

<li><b>Don't write complex replacement bytecode</b> &mdash; Don't write 100
lines of new bytecode only to get a StackUnderflowError because you left off
an ALOAD_0 somewhere.  If you need to do anything complex, gather up any
private members you need (or make them public) and pass them off to a static
method you write in Java source to do the hard stuff.</li>

<li><b>Look at the examples</b> &mdash; HDFontMod.java is fairly simple.  It
modifies a single class and makes fairly straightforward bytecode changes that
are independent of each other.  HDTextureMod.java is a beast, but it has
examples of nearly all of MCPatcher's capabilities.</li>
