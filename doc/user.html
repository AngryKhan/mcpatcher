<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>MCPatcher is a program that patches Minecraft so it can support higher
resolution texture packs than the game's default 16x16.  It also adds support
for custom lava, water, and portal animations.  Version 1.x of MCPatcher could
only patch the game to support a single resolution at a time, and had limited
support for switching between texture packs within the game.  Version 2 allows
you to switch between any size texture pack on the fly.</p>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>Start MCPatcher by double-clicking the jar file.  The main window should
appear:</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img alt="" src="images/screen001.png" width="520" height="537" />
</div>

<p>If you've used MCPatcher before, the first thing you'll notice is that
there's place to select your texture pack.  That's because you no longer need
to.  Place all your texture packs no matter the resolution into the
<code>&lt;minecraft dir&gt;/texturepacks</code> folder and choose between them
in-game.</p>

<p>In the simplest case, all you need to do is press <b>Patch</b> and wait for
it to finish.  Then, pressing <b>Test Minecraft</b> will launch the game in
single-player mode.  For multiplayer, run Minecraft via the launcher as
usual.</p>

<h3>Other features</h3>

<p>The <b>Browse</b> buttons let you select a different input or output jar.
MCPatcher automatically finds your Minecraft installation, so you should rarely
need to use these.</p>

<p><b>Unpatch</b> will restore Minecraft to the state it was in before the
first time you ran MCPatcher.  If you had other mods loaded before MCPatcher,
they will still be there.  If you loaded them after running MCPatcher, you
will need to reinstall them.  Unpatch also resets Minecraft to the default
texture pack.  This is because an unpatched Minecraft will crash on
texture packs larger than 16x16.</p>

<p>The <b>Mods</b> window lets you enable or disable individual mods.  If a mod
is greyed out, that means it is not compatible with your version of Minecraft.
This could mean an update came out that broke MCPatcher, or you have a mod
conflict that MCPatcher cannot resolve.</p>

<p>The <b>Log</b> window gives detailed information about what MCPatcher is
doing and lists any errors that occur.</p>

<p>The <b>Class Map</b> and <b>Patch Summary</b> windows give detailed
information about Minecraft and the patching process.  This is mostly useful
for troubleshooting and to mod developers.</p>

<h3>Using MCPatcher with other mods</h3>

<h4>Other mods + MCPatcher</h4>

<p>If you are using other mods, it is best to install them <em>before</em>
running MCPatcher.  MCPatcher does its best to work with other mods you may
have installed.  It is designed to change only certain parts of the code and
leave everything else alone.  If you have other mods installed, MCPatcher will
warn you that there may be problems, but it will attempt to continue.</p>

<h4>MCPatcher + Other mods</h4>

<p>It is possible to install other mods after running MCPatcher, but only if
they do not replace any classes modified by MCPatcher (see the Patch Summary
window for a list).  If another mod overwrites a class that MCPatcher has
patched, Minecraft will almost certainly either fail to launch entirely or
crash shortly after startup.</p>
